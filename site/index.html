                                The solution consist of StockData class which uses the array currencyPairs to keep a track of new/updated currency pair.
                                StockData calls currencyPairElement to create a row for a new currency pair and in case of updation, removing that row from dom 
                                and creating a new one with updated data and at the right position
                            </p>

                    them</strong>
                <p>
                    I have used mocha as a testing framework and used jsdom to deal with dom elements. Also chai for assertion. please run <strong>npm test</strong> to run
                    the tests
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Which libraries/frameworks you would have liked to have used (if any), and how they would have
                    made

                <p>
                    I would surely go with ReactJS to solve this problem, since there is a lot of dom manupulation. The virtual DOM would take care if my data is updated for each table row.
                    Also the component styled architecture would have given me the flexilbility to create flexible solution.
                    I have tried to use the same approach as virtual DOM of ReactJS since i am manupulating only that row which has changed.
